# Project_1
Tic Tac Toe game for beginners

## HTML
I first set up my html page. I set up a table full of
buttons. I filled the buttons up with dashes as space
holders.

## CSS
I then worked on the CSS. I decided to keep the basic design
quite simple as I knew that I was going to need the extra time for Javascript.
I did do some fancy colors and shadows and such and am quite pleased with the overall
look of things for now. I do plan to go back over the design later and make it super fancy.

## JavaScript
I then started working on the Javascript. I had to try out a few different methods before I found one I was really comfortable with.
The first thing I addressed was just getting a basic out line of what I was going to do.
I worked in increments, gradually getting more complex as I went along. The first thing was to decide how
the program would decide if the button clicked was going to be X or O. I decided that O would be even and X would be odd.
I did that with the modulus(%) command. Then I went about telling the program how to identify if someone won
either through columns, rows or diagonals. Basically I wrote out the code for the rows and copy and pasted
that for columns and diagonals with some slight variations on each line. Then I wrote out alerts for if X won
or O won. It was very exciting to see those pop up on the screen. Overall I am very happy with
my project at this point.

## Challenges Faced
The challenges I faced during this project are as follows:
I did not have quite as much time as I wanted to work on it due to some personal issues.
Also I got confused in some parts on how to proceed and got a little frustated that I had to ask
for help. But alas, I did and am quite grateful for the help I did recieve.


##Things to Add Later
I want to add a counter and restart button. Those are things that I plan on addressing on the break
or sometime in the future. I also want to make it a bit more lively and modern looking insead of
having it look like something out of 1985. But ya know, its good for now considering how much
information I am presently lacking in this area.
